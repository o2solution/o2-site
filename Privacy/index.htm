</div>
<div>
GENERAL<br>
<small>There are many different ways you can use our services – to share information, to communicate with other people, or to create new content.

When you share information with us, for example by creating an account with us, we can make those services even better – to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.

<h3 style="font-family:opensans; padding-bottom:20px;">Where our processing of your information is covered by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”), or the Sri lanka Personal Data Protection Act 2022/09 (“PDPA”)</h3>
</small>
<br>
OUR PRIVACY POLICY EXPLAINS:<br>
<small>
*What information we collect and why we collect it.<br>
*How we use that information.<br>
*The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.<br>
We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses and browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to us; whether you are new to O2 Solutions or a long-time customer, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions, contact us.
</small><br><br>
TRANSPARANCY AND CHOICE<br><small>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used and control who you share information with. By providing personal information to us, you consent to us collecting, holding, using and disclosing your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You do not have to provide personal information to us, however, if you do not, it may affect your use of this Site or the products and/or services offered on or through it.<br>

You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, you may not be able to login to O2 SOLUTIONS or utilise other services.
</small><br><br>
INFORMATION WE COLLECT<br><small>
We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like what content of ours matters most to you.<br>

We collect information in the following ways:<br>

<br>*Information you give us. We collect information about you and your company as you register for an account with us, create or modify your profile, use, access, or interact with our services or our websites (including but not limited to when you upload, download, collaborate on or share content, including photos and videos). Such content includes any personal information or other sensitive information that you choose to include. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for an account with us. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card. We may present your name, email address or image to other users in your organisation, or otherwise associated with your account in order to assist in sharing or recommendations.<br>
<br>*Information we get from your use of our services. We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our services or you view and interact with our content. This information includes:
<br>*Device information – We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). We may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your account.
<br>*Log information – When you use our services or view content provided by us, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include:
details of how you used our service, such as your search queries;
telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls;
Internet Protocol address;
device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL; and
cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.
<br>*Contact information – When you choose to use the SafetyCulture services to invite members of your contact list to view an action or a template, or be part of your organisation, we may collect, sync and store certain contact information such as names, phone numbers and email addresses. This information may be sent to our servers for the purposes of providing those members of your contact list with an invitation to participate in the SafetyCulture services as directed by you.
<br>*Location information – When you use a location-enabled SafetyCulture service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.
<br>*Unique application numbers – Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to us when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.
<br>*Local storage– We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.
<br>*Cookies and anonymous identifiers – We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit our services, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or SafetyCulture features that may appear on other sites..
<br><br>
</small><br><br>
HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT<br><small>
We may use the information we collect, including your personal information and transaction information, from all of our services in any one or more of the locations that SafetyCulture has operations or otherwise conducts business (these locations currently being Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and the Philippines) for the following purposes:

<br>*for internal and service-related purposes, such as to provide, maintain, protect, improve, and personalise our services, to develop new ones and to protect the rights, property, or safety of SafetyCulture and our users;
<br>*to communicate with you in order to provide you with information we think may be useful or relevant to you;
<br>*to promote our services and related services;
<br>*to analyse information in order to offer aggregated anonymised data products to third parties;
<br>*to facilitate the sharing of aggregated and anonymised information with third parties, including transaction data. An example of anonymised information would be the number of times a template is used or location data , which may be used by those third parties to inform judgements about the organisation using the software, but not about any individuals whose data is processed using the software;
<br>*to enforce the Privacy Policy and our terms and conditions for use of our services and websites;
<br>*to monitor and analyse trends, usage, and activities in connection with our services and for marketing or advertising purposes or to offer you tailored content;
<br>*to investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions, unauthorised access to or use of our services, and other illegal or unusual activities;
<br>*to use the name you provide for your SafetyCulture profile across all of the services we offer that require a SafetyCulture account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your SafetyCulture account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible SafetyCulture profile information, such as your name and photo;
<br>*when you contact us, to keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements;
from cookies and other technologies, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services;
<br>*to combine information from one service, including personal information, into other SafetyCulture services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know;
<br>*as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy.<br>
To use the information we collect, we may require our systems to access, screen capture, store, video and/or scan your information. Where appropriate or required by data protection laws, we will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.</a>
</small><br><br>
RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA<br>
<small>
We will retain your personal information for the time necessary to provide the services we perform for you, or to achieve other purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you can always request that we stop processing or delete your personal information.<br>

We’re required to keep some of your information for certain periods of time under law. When we no longer require your information, we’ll ensure that your information is destroyed or de-identified.<br>

We may need to retain certain personal information after we cease providing you with products or services to enforce our terms, for fraud prevention, to identify, issue or resolve legal claims and/or for proper record keeping.<br>
</small><br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION OUTSIDE SRI LANKA <br>
<small>
O2 SOLUTIONS processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.<br>

We may disclose personal information outside of Sri Lanka to third parties for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.<br>

By providing us with personal information, you consent to the disclosure of your personal information to third parties who reside outside Sri Lanka. Where we disclose your personal information to third parties, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that any overseas recipient will deal with such information in a way that is consistent with the Sri Lankan Privacy Principles.
</small><br><br>
INFORMATION YOU SHARE<br>
<small>
Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content.
</small><br><br>
INFORMATION WE SHARE<br>
<small>
We do not share personal information with third parties unless one of the following circumstances apply:<br>

*With your consent<br>
We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of O2 SOLUTIONS when we have your consent to do so.<br>
*With account administrators<br>
If your account is managed for you by an organisation administrator then your organisation’s administrator and resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your information (including your email and other data).
Your account administrator may be able to:<br>
view statistics regarding your account;<br>
change your account password;<br>
suspend or terminate your account access;<br>
access or retain information stored as part of your account;<br>
receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;
restrict your ability to delete or edit information.<br><br>

*With Third Party Service Providers<br>
We may disclose personal information to:
third party service providers for the purpose of enabling them to provide their services, including (without limitation) IT service providers, data storage or management, web-hosting and server providers, debt collectors, maintenance or problem-solving providers, marketing or advertising providers, customer lifecycle management providers, data analytics or reporting providers, finance systems, cyber security providers, project management or collaboration providers, testing, research and alert tools, email service providers and payment systems operators;<br>

<br>*For legal reasons

If we receive a request from a regulatory body or law enforcement agency, and if permitted under GDPR, the PDPA and other laws, we may disclose certain information to such bodies or agencies.
<br>*Merger or acquisition<br>
If we merge with or are acquired by another business, we may share your personal information with the new owners of the business and their advisors. We will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.<br>
We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. This could also include government bodies, industry groups, insurers and educational/training facilities.
</small><br><br>
INFORMATION SECURITY<br>
<small>
We have put in place robust measures regarding the security of the information we collect and store about you (including through the use of network and database security measures) and will use our reasonable endeavours to protect your personal data from unauthorised access to or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction. In particular:<br>

We encrypt many of our services using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS).<br>
We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorised access to systems.<br>
We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.<br>
We have multiple authentication and access control measures to ensure data is only accessed by authorised personnel.<br>
We enforce strong encryption of all data at rest through the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256).<br><br>
The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our servers via third party networks; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
</small><br><br>
